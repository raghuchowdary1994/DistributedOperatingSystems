Output is given in TextFile "Sol.txt"

Size of Work Unit:
We have made around 2000 actors for Input range n1 - n2
So we calculate worksize of each actor as (n2-n1)/2000
For Input Range 100000 - 200000, 2000 actors are generated each of size 50.
For Input Range 100000 - 1000000, 2000 actors are generated each of size 450.

Result of Running program:
Range 100000 - 200000, we got around 57 Vampire Numbers
Output is given in TextFile "Sol.txt"

Running time for Program:
(user + System) / real
For problem 100000 - 200000,
real	0m1.010s
user	0m4.547s
sys	0m0.159s
(5.253 + 0.153)/0.984 = 4.659 > 1

Largest Problem the Program solved:
